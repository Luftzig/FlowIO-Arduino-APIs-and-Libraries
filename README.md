# FlowIO-Arduino-APIs-and-Libraries

IMPORTANT NOTE: This repository includes only the lowest layers of the software stack for FlowIO that lie below the firmware layer (https://www.softrobotics.io/software-stack). The higher layers of the FlowIO stack, including the firmware that lets you control FlowIO via Bluetooth, are kept in a separate private repository accessible to users and contributors of FlowIO upon request.
