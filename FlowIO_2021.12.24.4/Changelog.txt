- Renamed "_valveOpenedAt[]" to "_startTimes[]" in the .h and the Driver.

2021.12.24.1
- Previously, the "_startTimes[]" array was serving a double duty where in
  addition to holding the start times it also held information about whether
  a valve was already in an power optmized ON state. Now this secondary
  functionality has been dedicated to a boolean array named _powerOptimized[].
- The variable type of _startTimes[] array was changed from int to uint32_t
  because it no longer needs to hold a negative value.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.

2021.12.24.2
- Added two more positions to the _startTimes[] array for the two pumps.
- Record the start times of the pumps into the array.
- Reset the start time of a pump to 0 when the pumps is stopped.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.

2021.12.24.3
- Add the getter: uint32_t getStartTimeOf(Component name). If a component is
  currently active, this will return its starting time, else it will return 0.

2021.12.24.4
- Updates the keywords.txt to include all literals and functions defined till now.
- Add the inflateP() function definition in FeedbackControl.cpp.
- Add the inflatePcomplete flag in .h header.
- Put the time depended methods in FeedforwardControl.cpp
- Fixed a bug where inflateP() did not display the correct inflation time because I was
	reading the start time after the stopAction() function, which resets the start time to 0.
- Fixed an issue where the sensor does not work after reset button is pressed, by placing the 
	activateSensor() function inside a while loop instead of an if block. Activation always 
	fails the first time, and then succeeds the second time, hence why we need the while loop.	
- Updated the Hardware Test example with the fix for sensor failure after reset. 
- Updated all other examples with the fix for the sensor failure after reset.




- TODO: Test the inflateP method in all cases imaginable. Especially focus on testing it
  in the case where inflation is already happening on the same ports to see if the time
  it returns add the additional inflation time prior to the first invocation of he function.
  Test if you can reinvoke inflateP on a different port after you reset the inflatePcomplete flag.
  Test what happens if you invoke inflateP twice in the same iteration but with different ports.
    What should happen in such a case is the first inflateP() in the loop will barely cause anything
  because it will get overwritten by the next one in microseconds. Thus only the second inflateP will
  have an effect.
